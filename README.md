A textbase game where you conquer the world!!

V-0.1.4 updates

Make the menu options more compact(have menus in menus if you know what I mean).

Add a barracks building that can turn a persontype into a fighter

Revise the structure of the whole program. See if there is a way to make it better in the future.(If we continue like this we're fucked)
  -have less stuff in the driver and move it more to the other class
  -toStrings could be a huge "line saver"
  
Incorporate levels for buildings. Find a smart way to do it and how this leveling up will affect a building

make the player pay extra resources at the end of each year. Makes the game more difficult

make a help so we dont have to explain as much in game. Maybe have help option with options in the options for each category?
